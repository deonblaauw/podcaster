## Podcast Generator

This script generates a podcast episode featuring a conversation between two AI models‚Äîa host and a guest‚Äîbased on a specified topic. It produces both text and audio outputs, along with a summary and relevant hashtags based on the generated dialogue.

### üéØ Features

- **AI-Generated Conversation**: Simulates a dynamic conversation between a host and a guest AI on a given topic.
- **Text-to-Speech Support**: Converts the generated text into speech using OpenAI's TTS engine (default) or Microsoft Edge's TTS engine.
- **Audio Output with Background Music**: Creates an audio file with background music, complete with fade-in and fade-out effects.
- **Summary and Hashtags**: Generates a summary of the dialogue and relevant hashtags for social media promotion.
- **Customizable Output**: Adjust the duration, output directory, and TTS engine according to your preferences.

### üì• Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:deonblaauw/podcaster.git
   cd podcaster
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**:

   The script requires API keys for OpenAI and Pexels.

   #### Setting Environment Variables on macOS

   Open your terminal and add the following lines to your `.zshrc` file:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.zshrc
   ```

   Add:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_KEY='your_openai_api_key'
   export PEXELS_KEY='your_pexels_api_key'
   ```

   Save and exit (`Control + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`), and then reload your shell:

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

   **Note**: Replace `'your_openai_api_key'` and `'your_pexels_api_key'` with your actual API keys.

---

### üéÆ Usage

Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python gen_podcast.py "Your podcast topic" [options]
```

#### Example

```bash
python gen_podcast.py "The Future of Artificial Intelligence" --duration 30 --tts openai --output_dir my_podcast
